Title: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
Severity: Medium
Explanation: <p>The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.</p>
Recommendation: <p>Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.</p><p>If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's \"frame-ancestors\" directive.</p>

Give a friendly, short explanation in plain English to help the student understand whatâ€™s happening and what they should do to fix it."}

This is when an attacker tricks a user into clicking something different from what the user perceives, which can compromise the security of your web page.

The fix involves adding a safety feature to your web page through HTTP headers - Content-Security-Policy or X-Frame-Options. 

If you expect your page to be included within another page on your same site (i.e., in a frame), you should use an option called SAMEORIGIN. And, if you don't expect your page to be framed at all, use the DENY option. 

Another option is to set up a Content Security Policy's \"frame-ancestors\" directive, which gives you more control over which sites can embed your page. Implementing these will strengthen the security of your website.","annotations":[],"toolCalls":[],"functionCall":null},"logprobs":null,"finishReason":"stop"}],"usage":{"promptTokens":226,"completionTokens":180,"totalTokens":406,"promptTokensDetails":{"audioTokens":0,"cachedTokens":0},"completionTokensDetails":{"audioTokens":0,"reasoningTokens":0,"acceptedPredictionTokens":0,"rejectedPredictionTokens":0}}}}}
