Title: Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream.
Severity: Low
Explanation: Found object deserialization using ObjectInputStream. Deserializing entire Java objects is dangerous because malicious actors can create Java object streams with unintended consequences. Ensure that the objects being deserialized are not user-controlled. If this must be done, consider using HMACs to sign the data stream to make sure it is not tampered with, or consider only transmitting object fields and populating a new object.
Recommendation: Check coding best practices or linting rules.

Give a friendly, short explanation in plain English to help the student understand whatâ€™s happening and what they should do to fix it."}

To fix this, make sure any deserialized object isn't under user's control or sign the data stream with HMACs. HMACs help make sure the data hasn't been tampered with. You can also just send individual fields of the object instead of the entire object. A 'linting rule' is a guideline that programmers follow to avoid such issues, so check them to improve your code.","annotations":[],"toolCalls":[],"functionCall":null},"logprobs":null,"finishReason":"stop"}],"usage":{"promptTokens":160,"completionTokens":123,"totalTokens":283,"promptTokensDetails":{"audioTokens":0,"cachedTokens":0},"completionTokensDetails":{"audioTokens":0,"reasoningTokens":0,"acceptedPredictionTokens":0,"rejectedPredictionTokens":0}}}}}
